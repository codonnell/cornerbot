# Cornerbot

## Setup

Rename `bot.db.skeleton` to `bot.db` as well as `conf.json.skeleton` to
`conf.json`. Then run `go build`, and `./cornerbot`!

If you want custom action commands or message commands, rename `actions.txt.skeleton` 
to `actions.txt` (or `messages.txt.skeleton` to `messages.txt`, resp.) and add 
or remove as you please. The first character of each line is the character which
separates the command from its action or message.
